DrugWars303
===========

A new take on the classic Drugwars game for the TI-83. Buy low, sell high, but this time, in Denver. 

All testing is done onmy TI-84 Plus Silver Edition. 

TODO:
Furture graphics include using the Denver RTD Lightrail map as well as enhanced user interface. 


Still need to switch Ludes to Vicodin since, yknow, Ludes are extinct. 

All L vairables become V, V become L

Variable V is used for the bank account balance.
